# 📱 Flutter Authentication UI

This is my **first Flutter project**, where I built a simple **authentication user interface** using Flutter.

The project focuses on creating clean UI screens such as:
- Welcome Screen
- Sign Up Screen
- Login Screen

It was created as a **learning project** to practice Flutter layouts, widgets, and navigation.

## ✨ Features
- Welcome screen with navigation to Login & Sign Up
- Sign Up form with multiple input fields
- Login screen UI
- Clean UI using custom colors and Google Fonts
- Simple navigation using `Navigator`
- Organized project structure

## ⚠️ Notes
- This project focuses on **UI only**
- No backend or authentication logic implemented
- Validation is not fully implemented
- **Not fully responsive** on all screen sizes
- Built mainly for learning and practice purposes
